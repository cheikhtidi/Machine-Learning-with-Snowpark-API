In this project,  we experience how Snowpark for Python enables you to use familiar syntax and constructs to process data where it lives with Snowflake's elastic, scalable and secure engine, accelerating the path to production for data pipelines and ML workflows. Here's what you were able to complete:
Loading and transforming data via Snowpark
Apply scalable data transformations with Snowpark ML
Train, score and evaluate models with Snowpark ML
Hyperparameter Tuning with Snowpark ML
